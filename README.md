ErrorMessage "torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.22 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of
15.77 GiB of which 959.44 MiB is free. Process 12447 has 14.83 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 14.01 GiB
is allocated by PyTorch, and 472.05 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory 
is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation 
for Memory Management  (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)"
